# RL Crash Course: From Bellman to Bots

## Part 1: Concepts & Mathematical Foundations
In this section, we will establish the intuition behind Reinforcement Learning (RL), understand when to use it (and when not to), and derive the mathematical equations that power modern agents.

## Part 2: Part 2: Building a Custom Environment with Gymnasium
In this section, we transition from theory to practice. We will learn the industry-standard API for RL environments and build a custom simulation of a server room thermostat from scratch.

## Part 3: Training with PPO and Advanced Frontiers
In this final section, we will replace our random agent with a state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm. We'll train it to perfectly manage our server room, discuss how to tune it, and briefly explore the cutting-edge of RL.

# Module 5: Architecture Design

## Introduction to APIs

Session 1: Concepts of APIs (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, etc.)

Session 2: We'll introduce the FastAPI framework, a modern web framework for building APIs. Building on our advanced Python skills, we'll design and create our first API endpoints.


## Architecture Design Patterns

Session 3: We'll explore different system architectures, comparing the benefits and drawbacks of monolithic vs. microservice designs.

Session 4: This session covers the principles of event-driven vs. message-driven architectures. We'll discuss how asynchronous communication through message queues can help build scalable and decoupled systems.
